##  - / Assignment Overview
##  - The API must also cater for the following entities:
##  - User
##  - Post
##  - Comment
##  - Category
##  - To reduce complexity please note that a post may only belong to one category.
##  - A swagger document that outlines all of the API endpoints.
##  - Please note that we specifically want to test knowledge and implementation of design patterns.

##  - You will need to create a logger that will log all API requests and responses. This class will however have to use the GATEWAY PATTERN so that the storage system can be changed from database to files.
##  - You will need to demonstrate an understanding of the REPOSITORY PATTERN during your database interactions.
